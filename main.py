# This dataset includes information on over 9,000 animal bites which occurred near Louisville,
# Kentucky from 1985 to 2017 and includes information on whether the animal was quarantined after the bite occurred and whether that animal was rabid.

df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/shalev/Desktop/Health_AnimalBites.csv')
print( df.shape)  # Geting the scale of the data set


# THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE DATA SET:
# bite_date: The date the bite occurred
# SpeciesIDDesc: The species of animal that did the biting
# BreedIDDesc: Breed (if known)
# GenderIDDesc: Gender (of the animal)
# color: color of the animal
# vaccination_yrs: how many years had passed since the last vaccination
# vaccination_date: the date of the last vaccination
# victim_zip: the zipcode of the victim
# AdvIssuedYNDesc: whether advice was issued
# WhereBittenIDDesc: Where on the body the victim was bitten
# quarantine_date: whether the animal was quarantined
# DispositionIDDesc: whether the animal was released from quarantine
# headsentdate: the date the animalâ€™s head was sent to the lab
# release_date: the date the animal was released
# ResultsIDDesc: results from lab tests (for rabies)

# My research questions:
# 1.What are the unique types of animals?
# 2.who is the most common biter?
# 3.Who is the animal that bites the least?
# 4.how many bite cases per year?
# 5.What is the year with most bite cases and how many cases was in it and the same check about the year with the least bite cases.
# 6.Is there an increase in the number of bites per year?
# 7.What is the most common body part that geting bited(head or body)?
# 8.Percentage of people who contracted rabies following the bite
# 9.percentage of animals who died or killed during the quarantine

# Preparation the dataset to conduct the research questions:
# 1.fixing the date coulmuns (We want to delete the "00:00" fron evry cell)
# 2.delete the empty rows(when 'SpeciesIDDesc' is null)
# 3.Removing duplicates

# 2.delete the empty rows(when 'SpeciesIDDesc' is null)
